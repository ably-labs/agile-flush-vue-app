# ‚ô•‚ô£üöΩ Agile Flush üöΩ‚ô†‚ô¶

The Nr 1 and Nr 2 place for online planning poker!

This project is an example of how an online collaboration tool can be built that depends on realtime data synchronization between clients.

// TODO Diagram

The live version can be used here: [TODO]().

## The tech stack

The project uses the following components:

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) as the front-end framework.
- [Ably](https://ably.com/) as the realtime communications platform.
- [Azure Static Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/overview) to host the application.

## Running the app locally

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Azure Static Web Apps CLI](https://github.com/Azure/static-web-apps-cli)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools v4](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=v4)

For more info developing Static Web Apps locally see the [official Azure docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/local-development).

### Installation steps

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    üìù **Tip** - If you intend you deploy your own version of the app, you're better off forking this repo.

1. [Sign up](https://ably.com/signup) or [log in](https://ably.com/login) to ably.com, and [create a new app and copy the API key](https://faqs.ably.com/setting-up-and-managing-api-keys).
1. Add a file named `local.settings.json` to the `api` folder and add the following content:

    ```json
    {
        "IsEncrypted": false,
        "Values": {
            "AzureWebJobsStorage": "",
            "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "node",
            "ABLY_API_KEY": "<YOUR_ABLY_APP_KEY>"
        }
    }
    ```

    - Replace `<YOUR_ABLY_APP_KEY>` with the key you copied in step 2.
1. To install the dependencies for the Vue application, run this in the root of the repository:

    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```

1. To run the Vue application, run this in the root of the repository:

    ```cmd
    npm run serve
    ```

    The Vue app will be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

1. To install the dependencies for the Azure Functions application, run this in the `api` folder of the repository:

    ```cmd
    npm install
    ```

1. To start the Azure Functions runtime, run this in the `api` folder of the repository:

    ```cmd
    func start
    ```

    The Azure Functions app will be available at `http://localhost:7071`.

1. To start the Static Web App emulator, run this in the root of the repository:

    ```cmd
    swa start http://localhost:8080 --api-location http://localhost:7071
    ```

1. Now open the link that is output by the `swa` command (`http://localhost:4280`).

## Deploying the app to Azure

Once you forked this repository, you can deploy it to Azure via:

- [the Azure Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-portal?tabs=vue) or
- [the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/static-web-apps/get-started-cli?tabs=vue)

In both cases you can skip the repository creation step since you can use your fork of this repository.
